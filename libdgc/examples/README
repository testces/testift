READ THE MAKEFILE

In order to run the Dynamic Graph Cut for pixel/voxel segmentation, use
make dgc_pixel.

It will compile the libift and libdgc and like the file dgc_pixel.cpp with both
libraries. Your code inside your demo folder will do something similar.

You will need to copy the functions create_graph and graph_cut_diff_segmentation
to your code and follow the standard in the main function.
