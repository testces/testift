Usage:

To split a dataset, first execute CreateCSVfileforDataset.py to
generate a csv file containing all images of the dataset.

Example: python create_CSV_with_filepaths.py <image directory> <file extension> <fileout.csv> 

where image directory is /home/osaku/Eggs/pre/orig/ and file extension is png
    
Second, execute the SplitDataset.py as described below

python split_dataset.py <input csv file> <output folder> <number of splits> <type of sampling> <percentage of training samples/number of images per class>

 [1]   csv file containing all images of the dataset (as created by CreateCSVfileForDataset.py).
 [2]   output folder to save the csv files of the training and testing splits. 
 [3]   number of splits.
 [4]   sampling approach: 
       1 = sampling based on a percentage of images in the smallest class. 
       2 = sampling based on a percentage of images per class (the stratified approach). 
       3 = sampling based on the number of images per class (constrained to the size of the smallest class).
       4 = random sampling, independently of the class information and according to a given percentage of training samples.
 [5]   percentage of training samples in [0,1] or the number of images per class in the case of approach 3.


All scripts are compatible with python 2.7 or higher.
