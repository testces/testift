############## HOW TO SHARE FOLDER USING SSHFS ##############

Tutorial based on: https://askubuntu.com/questions/412477/mount-remote-directory-using-ssh

1) Install sshfs
sudo apt-get install sshfs


2) Generate key pair on your machine
ssh-keygen -t rsa

Press <enter> for the option
"Enter file in which to save the key (/home/your_home/.ssh/id_rsa):

If the pair of keys already exists, press <n> for the message below:
/home/your_home/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? 

Otherwise, press <enter> for the remaining options.

The pair of keys (public and private) will be saved on folder ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


3) Copy public key to the remote host (lutz):
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub your_user@lutz.lids.ic.unicamp.br

The public key of your machine will be added to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on your account on lutz.
Then, every time you try to log into lutz, the authentication will be done by its public key, without
requiring your password anymore.


4) Mount/share a directory from lutz to your machine:
Add to the end of your "~/.bashrc" file the following commands, only replacing the directory of lutz
that you want to mount/share and the directory on your machine that will be the mounting point.

################################################
# mount a directory
export LUTZ_SSHFS_MOUNT_DIR=$HOME/bases

if [ ! -d $LUTZ_SSHFS_MOUNT_DIR ]; then
    mkdir $LUTZ_SSHFS_MOUNT_DIR
fi
sshfs your_user@lutz.lids.ic.unicamp.br:/home/bases/LIDS/datasets -o ro $LUTZ_SSHFS_MOUNT_DIR -o reconnect
################################################


The variable LUTZ_SSHFS_MOUNT_DIR stores the directory on your machine where a given directory from
lutz will be mounted. You can
It is created if it doens't exist.

Then, a given directory from lutz, in the example the dir "/home/bases/LIDS/datasets", will be mounted
on the directory "bases" on your home.
You can choose any other folder on your machine for any other directory on lutz.

The option ro guarantees that "read-only" access for the folder "/home/bases/LIDS/datasets".
This is important since one could incorrectly erase some files by any chance.
Only remove this option if it is really necessary.

The option reconnect guarantees the connection will be reconnected if it is down.

These commands added to your .bashrc will be executed every time you open a session on your terminal.


5) (Optional) Unmounting a directory
fusermount -u directory_mounting_point_on_your_machine

TO unmount the directory of step (4), for example:
fusermount -u $LUTZ_SSHFS_MOUNT_DIR
